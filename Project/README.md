# Exploring Developmental Cell-to-Cell Interactions (CCI) within GABAergic interneurons

In this project, we use LIANA to predict the Ligand-Receptor interactions between different cell populations of the mouse developing brain cortex.We analyzed samples derived from a previous work by Allaway et. al, in which brain cortical interneuron cell nuclei were isolated from mice in development stages P10 and P28. 

For our analysis, we implemented a pipeline that could be categorized into three main steps 

1. Preprocessing scRNAseq data
2. Inferring CCI through a bootstrapped LIANA framework
3. Functional characterization and visualization results for downstream interpretation
